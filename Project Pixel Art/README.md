# Welcome to the Pixel Art project!  ðŸ‘‹

This project is a project developed during the Full-Stack Web Software Development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), in the Fundamentals of Web Development module, as a way to test and put the practices acquired during the course.

The project features a grid where you can color with standard colors or random colors when clicked on the random color button. You can also clean your drawing and define the size of the large one.

 1. The page must have the title "Palette of Colors".
 2. The page must have a palette of four different colors.
 3. The black color must be the first in the color palette.
 4. The page must have a pixel grid, with 25 pixels.
 5. Each element of the pixel frame must be 40 pixels wide and 40 pixels high and be delimited by a 1 pixel black border.
 6. When loading the page, the black color of the palette must already be selected to paint the pixels.
 7. When clicking on one of the colors in the palette, the selected color will be used to fill the pixels in the frame.
 8. When clicking on a pixel within the frame after selecting a color from the palette, the pixel must be filled with that color.
 9. Create a button that, when clicked, clears the frame by filling the color of all its pixels with white.
 10. Make a grid its user-defined size.
 11. Make the colors in the palette randomly generated when loading the page.
